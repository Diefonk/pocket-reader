Put txt-files in Data/net.diefonk.Reader/ to start reading.

When opening a file for the first time it will take some time to load it, but subsequent times it will open faster. Files that have been loaded once are displayed with [L] when selected in the menu. Those files no longer need the source file in the data folder. Files that still have the source file in the data folder are displayed with [S] when selected in the menu.

Menu controls:
* D-pad up/down to make selection.
* A button to open selected file.
* B button held for one second to delete loaded version of selected file, as well as the bookmark for that file. Only works if source file is also present.

Reading controls:
* Crank or d-pad up/down to scroll.
* D-pad left/right to jump to beginning/end of file.
* A button held to edit scroll speeds. D-pad left/right to edit crank speed, and up/down to edit d-pad speed.
* B button held to edit margins. D-pad left/right to edit x-margin, and up/down to edit y-margin. Y-margin will be displayed immediately. X-margin left will also be displayed immediately, but the file needs to be re-loaded (delete loaded version and open again) for the right margin to update.
